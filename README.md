## Description

_Late Night at the Studio_ is an interactive, choice-based narrative game built with p5.js. The project expands on a multi-screen, state-based game structure by introducing a branching story that unfolds through player decisions. The experience takes place in a quiet design studio late at night, where the player encounters a mysterious on-screen message and must decide how to respond.

The game includes a start screen, instructions screen, interactive game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. A player stat, **Trust**, is tracked throughout gameplay and directly influences which ending the player receives. The project emphasizes player agency, replayability, and narrative-driven interaction.

## Learning Goals

- Apply a state-based approach to manage multiple screens using a shared `currentScreen` variable
- Design an interactive story that branches based on player choices
- Track a player stat (Trust) across scenes and use it to unlock different endings
- Practice separating logic across multiple JavaScript files for clarity and maintainability
- Implement accessible UI interactions using both mouse input and keyboard controls
- Route `draw()`, `mousePressed()`, and `keyPressed()` functions based on the active screen

## GenAI

ChatGPT was used as a development aid to help structure and refine the p5.js code.  
The overall game concept, narrative direction, and design decisions were created by the author, with GenAI assisting in adapting the idea to fit the provided course template and technical constraints.
